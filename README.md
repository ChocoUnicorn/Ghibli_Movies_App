# Ghibli Movies App

Do you love Ghibli movies?  
In this app, you can compare the English version with the original (Japanese) one.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript(vanilla)

## Optimizations
I built this app with OOP concept (encapsulation) to create an English version object and a Japanese one.  
If there is some need to add movie items to this app, it's easier to change.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned **OOP** and **async/await, promise** while creating this app.  
I admit I have to get used to do that more, I'm pleased to complete this app at this point.

## Future plan:

I'd like to deploy this app to Netlify.
1. I need to hide my API key.
2. I need to learn backend like Node.js  
Once the right timing is coming, I'm sure to try it out!
